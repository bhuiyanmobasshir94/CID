# CID: Cow Images dataset for regression and classification
## Abstract
Cattle livestock trading is scaling with exponential growth and managing this scaled production and procurement has become a huge challenge for the industry. With a vision to solve these challenges with emerging technologies and state-of-the-art techniques from computer vision, we tried to develop a large possible dataset that is labeled and accurate so that our research community can build their novel models or finetune existing ones without the hassle of data collection. We developed our cow images dataset of 17,899 images with vitals (sex, color, breed, feed, age, teeth, height, weight, price, size) which can be used for both classification and regression. We are also contributing baseline models demonstrating how this dataset can be used for regression and classification. These baseline models consist of the multi input-output network(1 input - 2 outputs;3 outputs; 4 outputs) to classify and regress cattle livestock vitals among them (1 input - 2 outputs) have the best accuracy of 75% and67% respectively for age and breed with the minimum loss. Estimating or predicting cattle livestock vitals is an open research area and cow images dataset and baseline models will play a vital role in further research opportunities.
